variation 1
	chessboard = large object, contains game rules and movement logic
	makes sense because you need access to board to know how far you need to go
	BUT movement logic will be large, it would be cool if each piece was an object

variation 2
	have a chessboard and piece objects

variation 3
	have chessboard object, with a property of 2d array of piece objects
